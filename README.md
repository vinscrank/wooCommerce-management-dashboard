# wooCommerce-management-dashboard

The **Laravel API layer** acts as an abstraction over WooCommerce and stores data in a unified database.  
This approach allows seamless integration with other e-commerce platforms in the future (e.g., **Shopify**) without changing the frontend.  

The **React frontend** delivers a **modern and fluid user interface**, optimized for performance and usability.  
Data fetching and caching are powered by **TanStack Query**, ensuring smooth interactions and reduced API overhead.  

### Key Features
- Centralized management of products, categories, and variations  
- Unified API layer for WooCommerce (future-ready for other platforms)  
- Optimized data synchronization and caching  
- Fast and responsive UI with React + TanStack Query  
- Scalable deployment and modular design
